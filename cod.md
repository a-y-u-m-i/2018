Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. All ELSI guests and event attendees have the right to a space that is free of all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Harassment on the basis of any characteristic, protected or otherwise, is a form of misconduct. It is important to bear in mind that harassment is in the eye of the victim. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If you wish to report harassment, suspect that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizing committee immediately.
